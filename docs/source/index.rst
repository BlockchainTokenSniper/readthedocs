Welcome to the BlockchainTokenSniper documentation!
===================================

**BlockchainTokenSniper** is a set of tools written in Python to snipe tokens on the BSC, ETH and Polygon blockchains and sell later to make a profit.

This project is currently in Beta and only the BSC blockchain is supported at the moment, but ETH and Polygon will be supported in the future.
